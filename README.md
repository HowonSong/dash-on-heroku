#Dash On Heroku

##Description
Web application written in Python using Dash framework and deployed on Heroku

##What is it doing?
It's a single page webapp with two graphs:
1. CPU/Virtual Memory of the Dyno in real time
2. Bytes sent/recv in real time

##Motivation
I wanted to try out Dash and get  familiar with Cloud deployments.
